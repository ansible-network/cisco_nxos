# This file is used to make show commands to parser templates.  The top level
# key provide would correspond to the subset filter.  Each entry should only
# have two entries: command and parser.  The command is the command to run on
# the target device.  The parser is the name of the parser relative to the
# parser_templates/cli/ folder
#
# For example, lets assume we provide a top level subset call "system":
#
# system:
#   command: show version
#   parser: show_version.yaml
#
hostname:
  command: show hostname
  parser: show_hostname.yaml

version:
  command: show version
  parser: show_version.yaml

system_resources:
  command: show system resources
  parser: show_system_resources.yaml

system_uptime:
  command: show system uptime
  parser: show_system_uptime.yaml

vlan_brief:
  command: show vlan brief
  parser: show_vlan_brief.yaml

bgp_summary:
  command: show ip bgp summary
  parser: show_ip_bgp_summary.yaml
